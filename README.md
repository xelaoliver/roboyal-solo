# Robo-Yal Solo fix

Jelle Vermandere's RoboYal-Solo (Solo-Yal) has been broken since March, 2024... Until now. I won't be personally hosting the bot myself as I am unable to, but please feel free to host and read how to bellow. If you want to know how to play the all-time greatest Discord game, please visit [https://github.com/Jellevermandere/roboyal-solo](https://github.com/Jellevermandere/roboyal-solo).

# How to host the bot

- Download my Repository and unzip on your machine.
- Create a discord bot and paste your API key into credentials.py
- Import all of the custom emojis (made by Jelle himself) and modify customEmoji.py with the appropriate Emoji ID's
- Run main.py, and you should be able to play SoloYal!

Have fun!

# All credit for the origional Roboyal-Solo goes to Jelle Vermandere, I just fixed and maintaned the code so it works.
